				<div><p><b>2014</b></p>
					<p>Who runs the art world? Painters, of course! At least that's what BFA Painting major Diona thinks, until one bad critique sends her on a quest to battle for glory against the other, "lower" art disciplines. In this parody of Beyonce's “Who Run the World (Girls),” the lyrics are co-opted and rewritten as a critique of elitism between disciplines in the art market and higher education system, with a humorous spin and trippy visuals.</p>
