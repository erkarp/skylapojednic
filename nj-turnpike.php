					<p>By traveling the New Jersey Turnpike often and noticing the visual complexities of the terrain, I set out to photograph the site-specific visual relationships created by nature and man-made technologies, and specifically, how one encroaches on the other.</p>
					<p>Through photographing sites visible via the NJ Turnpike using a 4″ x 5″ camera, I discovered the difficulties a photographer encounters when photographing certain locations. In many spots, warning signs discouraging photography or “suspicious activity” of any sort were posted, and threatened to arrest and fine those found using a camera.</p>
					<p>During my time creating this series, run-ins with cops were not uncommon. While I believe my images succeed in highlighting the relationship between man and nature, a series which was simple in theory also turned into a political statement of what I could get away with as a photographer living in the United States post- 9/11.</p>
