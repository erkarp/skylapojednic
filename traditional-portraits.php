					<p>An essay titled “Tracing Photography” by Elizabeth Edwards outlines situational contexts surrounding the term “natural environment”, and why anthropologists who enter into unknown cultures cannot capture (via observation or photography) the essence of a person or peoples’ “natural environment”. The reasoning behind this is because the anthropologist has already disrupted the “naturalness” of the environment by being present.</p>
					<p>The idea that no portrait or photo containing a person can be natural made me want to push the boundaries of naturalness in portraiture. I went on to practice this idea with my family and friends. The shoot for each subject was a very slow and deliberate process to provoke a sense of relaxation in the subject.</p>
