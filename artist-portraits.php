				<p>The challenge of defining “success”  in the art community spurred the creation of a visual ethnography project documenting the studio, work, and/or natural environments of artists/students, and faculty at Mason Gross. I met with and photographed artists in their studios, offices, or general areas of practice. An interview was also conducted in which I asked them various questions about how they perceive success in the artist community.</p>
				<p>Their interviews were recorded on a camcorder and portraits were shot digitally and with an analog camera. Every interview and photo shoot was unique to each artist, and attempted to wholly encompass the environment, attitude and artistic processes they work to maintain.</p>
				<p>Artists and faculty photographed and interviewed: James Brittingham, Chris Camperchioli, Marc Handelman, Catherine Murphy, Will Laughlin, Irina Ari, Francesca Fiore, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Dustin Metz, Jason Carey-Sheppard, Max Cemeno.</p>
