			<div><p><b>February 2014</b></p>
				<p>"Solo Jazz" was a performance / art show curated by visual art students of Mason Gross, to benefit the senior BFA thesis shows. Artwork from senior BFA students was for sale through a silent auction happening throughout the night.</p>			<p>Among the goods being sold were custom made "boob shirts" which featured silkscreened images of some female students breasts. The show was held at a show house which often hosts underground indie and punk shows, often referred to as "basement shows". I bought a boob shirt, and ended up having a bunch of fun. A lot of my friends were there.</p> 
				<p>In addition to musicians, there were poets, and performance artists performing throughout the night. I made sure to take selfies with my friends, and I even met some new ones, too!</p>
