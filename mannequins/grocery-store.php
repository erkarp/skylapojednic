			<div><p><b>December 2013</b></p>
				<p>Grocery shopping can be a awkward when you're naked. You're just minding your own business as you pick out your fruits, milk, eggs, and veggies, while people around you are gasping. Hey, I may be a mannequin, but I'm not a freak.</p>
				<p>I arrived to the store in pieces. Lying with the chicken breasts and meats, I felt right at home. From time to time I'm treated like meat so we had that in common. (The meat told me it doesn't like the way it's treated, either.) Just kidding.</p>
				<p>Shopping can be a colorful experience. And there is a lot of black in grocery stores if you haven't noticed before. The dividers with prices on them, the metal material near the ground under the veggies, and a lot of the large bins containing a variety of items. The black contrasted the colorful fruits, veggies, and packaging.</p>
				<p>After picking up my favorite fruits and veggies, I of course, had to pick up the staples: milk and eggs. Thankfully, I didn't forget anything, even without having a grocery list.</p>
