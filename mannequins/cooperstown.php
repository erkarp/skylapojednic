				<p>Who doesn't love baseball? NO ONE, that’s the answer. (Especially the Cooperstown locals! They live there because they love baseball.) After visiting the Cooperstown Cheese Company, we made our way to the world famous Baseball Hall of Fame located in downtown Cooperstown, NY. Boy, was our drive far, Cooperstown is in the middle of nowhere! No one is around in the winter so parking was easy (and free), and we took a few shots of us outside before we went in. Nice building, isn't it? Unfortunately our camera ran out of film so we didn’t have any shots of us inside the museum.</p>
