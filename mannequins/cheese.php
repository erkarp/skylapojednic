			<div><p><b>December 2013</b></p>
				<p>Cooperstown Cheese Company owners Sharon Tomaselli and Bob Sweitzer let us tour their cheese factory in December. We even helped make a batch of cheese! After warming the milk, adding the enzymes, and stirring the whey, we looked at the rest of the work area. Cheeses recently removed from the presses and molds were sitting on nearby tables, and were waiting to be painted with wax before being moved into the cheese cave. We also got a look at the cheeses currently aging in their cheese caves. It was a fantastic experience that was so exciting we had to throw our hands up in the air. They had us wear hairnets even though we don't have hair! Health safety precautions, you know.</p>
				<p>We brought along our 35mm camera and took photos of us in all parts of the factory. Near the cheeses, the viewfinder skewed our bodies and the cheese wheels in fascinating ways. The focus of the image switched between what was seen through the viewfinder, and us in front of the camera. Switching the focus is meant to put emphasis on the fact that the camera is an instrument used to capture us posing in a situation we would post on social media, or put into a frame. (These will be going on our mantle.)</p>
