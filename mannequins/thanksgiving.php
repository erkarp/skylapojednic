			<div><p><b>November 2013</b></p>
				<p>We had a LOT of eggnog. We were so busy having fun during Thanksgiving dinner that we forgot to take pictures until after we'd already eaten the turkey. Oh, well. We pulled ourselves together and took a few shots of us enjoying some drinks and dessert!</p>
				<p>There’s one shot of us which also features our 35mm camera capturing us. This is meant to draw attention to the camera, of course. This portrait will definitely be featured on social media later when we find the film months later and scan it.</p>
