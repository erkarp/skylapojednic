			<div> 
				<p>Photographer and media artist Skyla Pojednic creates work containing intimate, voyeuristic, and self-reflexive statements exhibited through such themes as sexuality, gender, environment, and community. Her goal is to inspire and influence the public on these themes.</p> 
				<p>Through working with a variety of people and locations, Pojednic continues to find the notion of control to be a strong part of her practice, in concept, subject, and especially installation.</p> 
				<p>Pojednic has been heavily influenced by the intimacy and honesty portrayed in works by artists such as Nan Goldin, Maria Abramovic, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Gary Schneider, and Bruce Naumann. The highly political nature of Robert Mapplethorpeâ€™s work has also been of great influence.</p> 
				<p>Because contemporary photography is in constant competition with photographic technology, she believes it is essential to create work which promotes social importance. Installation is also used to assist in the promotion of the various social issues touched upon through the work.</p>
