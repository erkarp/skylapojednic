					<p>Skyla and Charlie Mott recreate a scene in which a critique is taking place, using only language specific to the photography medium. Fellow photographers, camera, editing, printing, and shooting terms, as well as adjectives are mentioned within the context of a conversation in a critique.</p>
					<p>The repeated statement “I like it” speaks to the often unimaginative responses provided during critiques, as well as the feelings the artists have about their own work. In addition to critiquing their own work, the artists are critiquing the critique process.</p>
					<p>Excerpt of a collaborative piece with Charlie Mott titled “Canon." The video plays on a loop and is projected in a room next to the lit pieces being “critiqued."</p>
