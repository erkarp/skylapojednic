				<p><i>"Damn, now that was a muscle memory."</i> - Liz Isenberg recalling "I Miss The Way You Draw Birds"</p>
				<p>Okay.</p>
				<p>It's taken me an insane amount of time to think of what to write for this session, for many reasons.</p>
				<p>1. I've loved Liz's music for so long but don't want to come off as a crazy overly-obsessed fan. </p>
				<p>2. I don't want to come off as not caring enough about Liz or this session by breezing past the writing just to have it done with. (Seems ridiculous to consider now that I write it out, but could be a possibility.) </p>
				<p>3. I don't want to let go of this session. It took me months to edit when it should've taken me days. We shot this session in August of 2010. It is almost three months into the next year. What kind of psycho overly-obsessed fan…? Hmm…okay, we've already gone down this road. But you get my point.</p>
				<p>I had lived in Providence a couple of Summers ago and ran along these waters so many times, oftentimes (ironically) while listening to Liz. I knew it'd be a perfect spot for filming. This session meant so much because Liz's music means so much to me. Luckily, Liz is the biggest sweetheart ever. She's happy, smiling and a true pleasure to be around. Then she plays her guitar, and opens her mouth and her voice is absolutely beautiful.</p>
				<p>Listening to Liz is a lot like reading a diary of a close friend. She's comfortable with sharing her thoughts in ways that make me feel completely comforted. I'd venture to say I know a lot about her through her music, a feeling you can get immediately from listening to her music, and a feeling many of her fans and I share.</p>
				<p>So I hope you like water because it makes a lot of noise.</p>

				<p>How much do you love the water lapping in the background?!</p>
				<p>There are a few other artists I've listened to for as long as her but Liz is "real", or at least "more real" than any artist I'd never have the chance to meet, talk to and laugh with. Many years ago in high school I was listening to Liz in my room when a friend called to let me know that a classmate of ours had passed away in a car accident. I remember the moment so clearly, and how it was so painfully framed around every sensory experience. Liz was a part of it. "Country Song" and "I Miss the Way You Draw Birds" were the songs from that night- two songs which were inevitably stuck in my head for weeks following that instrumental moment (haha, pun), and I found myself playing them on the guitar without any knowledge of the chords in a matter of days. There was a benefit for my classmate, which my two friends and I performed Liz's songs for. From learning her songs, to contacting her with questions about her lyrics, to listening faithfully for years, to finally seeing her at a show in PA and a couple since, Liz has been a major part of my auditory experiences in the past 5 yeas. And I wanted to share her music here.</p>
				<p>I asked if Liz could play "I Miss the Way You Draw Birds" because it f-ing rocks. Liz obliges, and I discovered that we play the song in slightly different ways- I play a few frets down on the guitar, her a few up. This was small, but interesting highlight moment for yours truly.</p>
				<p>You can read about Liz and her musical past in articles throughout the internet. What I'm here to say is: IF THIS WOMAN IS NOT FAMOUS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I HAVE NO FAITH IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS, PERIOD.</p>
				<p>She's a highly talented and learned musician, and very accomplished. Mastering banjo and guitar, recording two albums, having worked with Deer Tick, Vio/Mire and many other amazing artists, going on various tours, creating Trip Dicks (a hilarious and awesome current project you should go look up immediately) and so on, she is beyond deserving of mass attention. (If that's what she wants.)</p>
				<p>The whole praying mantis/flamingo/one legged performance thing was a hilarious bit because Liz rocks and was happy to do something else for funny camera angles etc. You saw, it worked right?</p>
