					<p><i>"I'm pretty sure cheese is one of the top three reasons we come to Earth."</i> - Glenna Van Nostrand</p>
					<p>Glenna lives out in a woodsy part of Massachusetts I hadn't encountered before.</p>
					<p>When I pulled in the driveway I was welcomed by Glenna's mother, who looked so much like Glenna it was obvious who she was without even meeting. She showed me inside. To put it in the words of my old "hippie ancestry", Glenna's house just had "those good vibes, <i>maaan</i>". Memories and pieces of their lives were posted in photos and art on warm, colorful walls. It's always so telling, walking into someone's home. Especially a home they'd been raised in, where their roots still remain and sometimes, are still growing strong.</p>
					<p>We first met at a concert in the heart of a deep northeast Winter, in a freezing NY loft. Glenna (as Omnivore), Brendan (as Vio/Mire) and Liz Isenberg had all played that night. All three of which I shot during this trip to Providence & Massachusetts. When I saw these guys I knew they were the kind of artists I wanted to film. Their work is so unique and deserving of publicity that I wanted to bring them to a new audience: learn about them and create an interpretation of their work they can always access.</p>
					<p>Glenna's smiling face greeted me as I made my way through to the kitchen. Walking right into her world, I felt like I knew so much about her. The nature of Glenna's music (her stage name- Omnivore) originated at college when exploring the performing arts. The music she works on most is not featured in this session at all- it's almost the complete polar opposite of what you see here. Ambient, simple and meaningful vocals looped over electronic clicks and mechanical ticks. Gorgeous, really. Look at Glenna's myspace link and another video which I will post on my personal vimeo. She also did a great session with One Night Music last April along with Liz.</p>
					<p>Glenna's acoustic music revealed a different side to her. Surprising mostly, because I'd never seen her perform with stringed instruments. Acoustic/string music is the staple of many musicians; any artist in the realm of "indie" seems to have started with a phase of exploratory acoustic and story-telling lyrics before moving onto another medium. This is true in Glenna's case.</p>
					<p>I was working really hard this Summer â€” 40-60 hours a week. So when I was working to hook up these sessions I knew it was going to be one of my few reliefs from work. It was such a fun time, getting to "go" on this adventure with such a talented musician. I mean this for all of the artists I shot during this trip. It was therapeutic and inspiring.</p>
					<p>Some time later, I found that I had filmed a lot, Glenna had prepared coffee, and a 19 year old cat was sleeping on the porch (Morris). What an epic name for a cat, first of all, and second of all, how many 19 year old cats have you met?</p>
					<p>It was like I had passed over all of the filming that had happened and gotten to the end before I knew it. It became an act which I fell into almost without any effort. Sight and sound came together for me in ways I hope can be translated through this video.</p>
					<p>We ate some brunch and chatted about astrology until Glenna had to get ready for work, time moving quickly.</p>
