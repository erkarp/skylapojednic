				<p><i>"I got in a duck boat"</i> - changing the lyrics to his song "Shrinking Coasts" (original lyrics: "I built a little boat") </p>
				<p>There's a unique music culture thriving in Providence. I was exposed to it a little while living there a couple of Summers ago, but it's really easy to see details of that culture within artists like Brendan and Liz. They're indie musicians that work together, assisting in everything from album production, to distribution, to touring. (Hope it's okay to call them this, despite whatever negative connotations it may have, they are indeed independent in more ways than the fact they're not on a record label.) As a whole, Providence is full of a lot of "indie" types of people- entrepreneurs and artists living happily together with other artists, sharing and exploring the mediums together. There's a collective help for expanding personal growth within the medium. It's awesome to see little communities of indie musicians traveling around, existing, playing and growing together. It's so cute! (Wow, hope you catch my sense of humor here. But really, in ways, it is.)</p> 
				<p>Brendan and Liz both came out of Hampshire College, and they're both holistic representations of what, in my mind, a Hampshire College student is like. In case you don't know, Hampshire College operates without a "classic" grading system. There's emphasis on each student's ability to set and achieve goals rather than receiving As and Fs. It's an alternative learning institution that has graduated some very accomplished folks, and is practical for the right people. These artists are motivated in their own ways, and I see that through their music big time and it's inspiring to see!</p>
				<p>This session was so much fun to shoot, you guyyys. It was hot but being in a swan boat and the breeze made it cooler, and was the perfect setup for nice visual contrasts between the artist and background. (At some points it even looks like Brendan is in front of a green screen..I'm here to say he was not.)
</p>
				<p>Brendan's gentle guitar and banjo melodies with intellectually insightful lyrics make for some great, relaxing music. I'll say the same for Liz's session, but I cannot stress enough how much of a treasure this music is for me personally. It's rare and unique, but deserving of recognition and is an amazing display of true talent. I wish I could be a record company, because then I would be making all the right decisions, investing in people like these...</p>
