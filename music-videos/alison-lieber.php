				<p><i>"Should I dangle you from the ceiling?"</i>- at my attempt to try a ridiculous camera angle</p>
				<p>Alison's been making music ever since high school. She was big into singing, starring in musicals and among the strongest altos in the school chorus, performing solos often. I know all of this because I went to school with Alison and sang alongside her (literally, right next to her) in chorus.</p> 
				<p>It was cool to observe my friends who were into musicals and music as they moved into producing their own music and exploring their passions, like we all see as we spend years alongside people and/or staying in touch with them years after moving apart.
</p>
				<p>Alison told me that her music had moved from an exploratory space to a stagnant one, which is no longer true (as I can see by stalking her myspace page-- Yay!). Even if she were taking a little break from music the fact remains that her music is heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and I was super excited to have her on board to film this session for that very reason.
</p>
				<p>So, we were both in Cooperstown. Because Cooperstown is brimming with opportunities for artistic skill expansion, we had a wide range of pianos to choose from. Just kidding. We went back to our old alma matter, which was weird becauseâ€¦who ever wants to do that again? Usually no one that is sane. So our crazy selves wandered in during summer construction time, which meant no one else was there that we could awkwardly run into, luckily. We shot in the auditorium where we'd had classes, sang, performed and both spent many hours. Pretty surreal and fun, we laughed a lot (as you might tell by the B roll in the video).
</p>
				<p>And to end it all a lovely, delicate voice atop serious piano music.</p>
				<p>Watching this all again makes me want to dive back into her music. So. Let's give her our best, eh?</p>
